			<h1>About</h1>
			<hr />
			<p>
				This is a website dedicated to elect_club, a club for elected
				electronic music producers/musicians alike, located primarily in
				Victoria, Australia. You may see here the ideas that the club is
				built upon, the projects we create/will create, how to join,
				etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				The club is specifically designed and cater to foster creativity
				given the following ideas.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Open-Source Music Concept:</strong> I propose applying
				open-source software principles (like FOSS) directly to music
				creation and the music industry. This approach, largely
				unexplored in music, offers immense potential to counter the
				industry's profit-driven limitations, commodification of average
				art, and barriers to creativity. It aims to make music creation
				more accessible and collaborative, envisioning a platform like
				"GitHub for music."
			</p>
			<p><strong>Key Personal Production Strategies:</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>Low-Fidelity Focus:</strong> Restrict early project
					listening to low-fidelity speakers (e.g., laptop speakers,
					NS10s) to isolate the mid-range. This forces the mix to
					mature before testing on high-fidelity systems, ensuring it
					translates well universally.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Minimum Song Commitment:</strong> Set a mandatory
					minimum time to work on a single song before switching
					projects. This combats my tendency to abandon tracks
					prematurely and fosters completion.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<strong>Call to Action:</strong> I aim to host in-person meetups
				for passionate producers seeking community beyond commercial
				pressures. Our dreams are ours to follow. I have developed
				methods to create uniquely creative music, moving past the
				constraints I previously accepted.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, I just wanted to touch on a few concepts that have
				crossed my mind somewhat frequently over the past few years.
				Sound bypasses the brain and talks straight to the nervous
				system. I heard also as well that we all perceive images quite
				differently from person to person, but that we perceive sound
				all entirely the same--this is unverified and you would have to
				research it, but a captivating notion and idea nonetheless;
				Vision is subjective hallucination—sound is universal physics.
			</p>

			<p>
				If this is true it speaks volumes to who we are and what we are
				capable of, beyond language. Language divides. Resonance unites.
				We are the tuning forks of a deeper signal. I find it
				interesting also that quantum physicists have also come to the
				'discovery' that reality is made up of waves and frequency--I
				quote discovery because, if they have truly discovered it, then
				why haven't they made the full and same connections that I
				have... perhaps there is something they are afraid of, something
				a little less predictable or controllable.
			</p>
			<p>
				Physics confirms what mystics knew: reality is vibration. The
				establishment fears resonance because you can’t tax a frequency.
				And thank God for that. God is a frequency we forgot how to
				hear. Or whatever you want to call it, be it Buddha, higher
				beings, Zeus, Gaia, Kali, Karma, Spirit... there are many names
				and words to reduce it to. All names fail. Only the hum remains.
				Only pattern, frequency and vibration.
			</p>
			<p>I look forward to working together.</p>
