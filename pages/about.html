			<h1>About</h1>
			<hr />
			<p>
				This is a website dedicated to elect_club, a club for elected
				electronic music producers/musicians alike, located primarily in
				Victoria, Australia. You may see here the ideas that the club is
				built upon, the projects we create/will create, how to join,
				etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				The club is specifically designed and cater to foster creativity
				given the following ideas.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Open-Source Music Concept:</strong> I propose applying
				open-source software principles (like FOSS) directly to music
				creation and the music industry. This approach, largely
				unexplored in music, offers immense potential to counter the
				industry's profit-driven limitations, commodification of average
				art, and barriers to creativity. It aims to make music creation
				more accessible and collaborative, envisioning a platform like
				"GitHub for music."
			</p>
			<p><strong>Key Personal Production Strategies:</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>Low-Fidelity Focus:</strong> Restrict early project
					listening to low-fidelity speakers (e.g., laptop speakers,
					NS10s) to isolate the mid-range. This forces the mix to
					mature before testing on high-fidelity systems, ensuring it
					translates well universally.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Minimum Song Commitment:</strong> Set a mandatory
					minimum time to work on a single song before switching
					projects. This combats my tendency to abandon tracks
					prematurely and fosters completion.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<strong>Call to Action:</strong> I aim to host in-person meetups
				for passionate producers seeking community beyond commercial
				pressures. Our dreams are ours to follow. I have developed
				methods to create uniquely creative music, moving past the
				constraints I previously accepted.
			</p>
			<p>I look forward to working together.</p>
