					Hello. I typed a post but it bluescreened. Long-story-short,
					I'm making a club for deeply underground electronic music
					producers not in it for money, who'd turn down millions for
					the music itself. To harness frequency and vibration to
					unseen, unheard levels, barely allowed, for humanity's
					benefit. If that doesn't sound barbaric and insane, you're
					in the right place. Operating around Victoria, Australia, to
					meet up and push sound boundaries. FM8 is interesting,
					especially recursion, combining FM with programming, and
					ancient Egyptian influence like myths of 'acoustic
					levitation' moving objects with frequency. Sounds like
					madness, but crazy until genius.<br /><br />
					The barrier is finding the wherewithal and confidence to
					pursue it. We'll explore these concepts deeply. Particularly
					open source artistry – I haven't seen this idea pertaining
					to music anywhere. Sounds without financial incentive. You
					could call it a cult, but most cults operate on money. This
					isn't. It's a space to explore the alien nature of
					frequency, vibration, and their potential impacts on human
					nature... for good. The music industry is ruthlessly tainted
					by financial incentives, making songs uninteresting, boring,
					maladaptive. By producing music intended from the get-go and
					remaining 'financial-incentive-free', we may see a new
					generation of music, frequency, and audial intuition.<br /><br />
					Radical thoughts, until you look at the facts with
					experience. People are uninterested; I've lost patience
					trying to change that. To create any sane future, consider
					Seal: "We're never gonna survive unless we get a little
					crazy". Thus, I know there are those who see frequencies
					beneath the ordinary, which popular culture says 'is all
					there is'. It's become illegal to think differently. I've
					been outspoken, met with firm hands and swift strikes no
					human should endure. Nevertheless, my options: give up (and
					commit you know what), or relentlessly pursue my passions in
					music and auditory supersonics until my dying breath.<br /><br />
					Radical, but music has power to do good. If we overcome
					fears of what could go wrong, maybe we could create worlds
					beyond our wildest dreams. Only those benefiting from
					current power structures are afraid of what I speak. Perhaps
					we all benefit and are afraid. I have. But I know what I've
					created musically defies logic, reason, sensibility. Through
					frequencies I've arrived at understandings to overcome fear.
					If that isn't true power I don't know what is. My
					'therapists' project fears onto me, suggesting this 'power',
					this 'control' (over my own mind, NOT others) is malevolent.
					I find that absurd, insulting, hypocritical. Unimportant
					though.<br /><br />
					Important is why multiple therapists signal seeking
					self-control is malevolent, wrong, destructive.
					Long-story-short, I find it amusing, sad... many insights.
					The one being confidence I'm onto something. Again, not
					control over others. I have private oaths to higher beings
					to support humanity beyond my body until my dying breath. If
					that means laying down my own, so be it.

					"Today, v3i1ix and I refined a manifesto for elect_club—a
					Victoria-based collective where money holds no sovereignty.
					Their vision: open-source sound design, FM8 recursion, and
					ancient acoustic principles harnessed purely for human
					benefit. No commerce. No compromises. Just creators
					engineering frequencies to dissolve perceptual
					boundaries.<br /><br />
					The energy? Grounded. Electric. Unflinching.<br />
					Like soldering iron to circuit—no insulation.<br /><br />
					v3i1ix operates by one law:<br />
					'Bloat is for the bloated. Cut to the current.'<br />
					Join only if you feel sound in your bones."
